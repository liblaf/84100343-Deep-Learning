## Task 2: Visualizing Saliency Maps

### Overview

In this task, we visualized the saliency maps of the `ResNet-18` model trained in Task 1. Saliency maps provide insights into which parts of the input image are most influential in the model's decision-making process. This visualization helps in understanding the model's behavior and identifying areas of interest in the input images.

### Code Implementation

The code for this task is provided in `task2.py`. The script loads the trained `ResNet-18` model and generates saliency maps for a random subset of test images using the Captum library. The saliency maps are then saved as images for further analysis.

### Saliency Map Visualization

Below is an example of the input image and its corresponding saliency map:

## Task 4: Improving Model Performance with Training Techniques

### Overview

In this task, we explored various training techniques to improve the performance of the `MobileNet V3 Large` model on the `PathMNIST` dataset. These techniques included data augmentation, learning rate strategies, and other optimization methods. The goal was to achieve an accuracy (ACC) greater than 0.9 on the test set.

Additionally, it uses a learning rate scheduler with warm-up epochs and cosine annealing. The training process includes logging the training loss and validation metrics (AUC and ACC) using W&B.

### Data Augmentation

We applied the following data augmentation techniques:

- **Random Horizontal Flip**: Flips the image horizontally with a probability of 0.5.
- **Random Vertical Flip**: Flips the image vertically with a probability of 0.5.
- **TrivialAugment Wide**: Dataset-independent data-augmentation with TrivialAugment Wide, as described in "TrivialAugment: Tuning-free Yet State-of-the-Art Data Augmentation"[^muller2021trivialaugment].
- **Random Erasing**: Randomly erases a portion of the image to improve robustness.

The combination of data augmentation and an optimized learning rate strategy led to significant improvements in both AUC and ACC. The ablation study provided insights into the individual contributions of each technique, demonstrating their effectiveness in enhancing model performance.

## Task 5: Fine-Tuning a Pre-Trained Model

### Overview

In this task, we fine-tuned a pre-trained `MobileNet V3 Large` model on the `PathMNIST` dataset. Fine-tuning involves initializing the model with weights from a pre-trained model and then training it on the new dataset. This approach leverages the knowledge gained from the pre-trained model to achieve better performance on the target dataset. We compared the fine-tuning process with training a model from scratch to understand the differences in learning rate and convergence speed.

### Code Implementation

The code for this task is provided in `task5.py`. The script loads a pre-trained `MobileNet V3 Large` model, freezes its convolutional layers, and replaces the final classification layer to match the number of classes in the `PathMNIST` dataset. The model is then fine-tuned on the `PathMNIST` training set, and its performance is evaluated on the validation and test sets. The training process includes logging the training loss and validation metrics (AUC and ACC) using W&B.

### Fine-Tuning Process

1. **Load Pre-Trained Model**: We used the `MobileNet_V3_Large_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V2` weights for initialization.
2. **Freeze Convolutional Layers**: The convolutional layers of the pre-trained model were frozen to retain the learned features.
3. **Replace Classification Head**: The final classification layer was replaced with a new linear layer to match the 9 classes in the `PathMNIST` dataset.
4. **Fine-Tune on `PathMNIST`**: The model was fine-tuned on the `PathMNIST` training set with a lower learning rate to avoid catastrophic forgetting.

The fine-tuning process demonstrated faster convergence and better performance compared to training a model from scratch. The lower learning rate used during fine-tuning helped in retaining the learned features from the pre-trained model while adapting to the new dataset. This task highlights the benefits of leveraging pre-trained models for transfer learning in achieving superior performance on target datasets.
